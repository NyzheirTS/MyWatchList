It felt boring for me and I stopped watching, but after few years, I decided to give it a chance and continue. I'm so happy because of my decision, because after finishing this TV show, I can definitely tell that it was a masterpiece! 5th season is a bomb and 14th season was shocking! It left me with sad, euphoric shock feeling. It was mind blowing! I'm not gonna spoil you what happened, but if you started first season and you don't like it, for goodness sake, give it a chance and continue watching. I promise you won't regret.\r\n\r\nCharacters are very well developed. Acting is superb! Plot is very interesting. Whole TV show is tense, especially the last season. The only downside I can think about is camera. Sometimes it's shaking on some certain scenes. I don't know why they didn't pay attention to this, but this is nothing, just a very minor minus. Everything else is great about this TV show.",
